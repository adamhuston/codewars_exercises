5 kyu - minimum unfairness of a list/array

We define the "unfairness" of a list/array as the minimal difference between 
max(x1,x2,...xk) and min(x1,x2,...xk), 
for all possible combinations of k elements you can take from the list/array; both minimum and maximum of an empty list/array are considered to be 0.

More info and constraints:

lists/arrays can contain values repeated more than once, plus there are usually more combinations that generate the required minimum;
the list/array's length can be any value from 0 to 106;
the value of k will range from 0 to the length of the list/array,
the minimum unfairness of an array/list with less than 2 elements is 0.
